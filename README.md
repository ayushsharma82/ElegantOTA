## ⚠️ Notice: Unauthorized Derivatives
I value open-source collaboration and community-driven innovation but it has come to my attention that certain similar-looking libraries are circulating in the community that have been developed by copying/masking the licensed source code from **ElegantOTA Pro** (our paid offering). In some cases, the original code has been partially reproduced in an attempt to circumvent DMCA violations.

I strongly condemn such practices, as they violate intellectual property rights and undermine the trust and integrity that open-source and licensed software communities rely on.

<br/>

## Supported MCUs

ElegantOTA works on the following microcontrollers/boards:

- ESP8266
- ESP32
- RP2040 (+WiFi / Pico W)
- RP2350 (+WiFi / Pico 2 W)
- *( more coming soon )*

<!-- <b>Antivirus Issue:</b> If you have an antivirus on your PC with internet security, the progress bar on webpage will instantly show 100% because of request caching by your antivirus software. There is no fix for this unless you want to disable your antivirus or whitelist your local IP addresses in it. ( Same is the case with iOS, safari will cache the outgoing requests ) -->

## Looking for more? Upgrade to Pro.

While ElegantOTA OSS (Lite) offers sufficient functionality for building a solid project, you may want to explore ElegantOTA Pro for additional advanced features which can be essential for your device:
- Exclusive Drag & Drop Zone
- Toggle OTA modes
- Hardware ID & Firmware Version on UI
- Whitelabel / Branding
- Commercial License

Atlast, It is a fantastic way to support the developer for the time went into the making & maintaining the library.
