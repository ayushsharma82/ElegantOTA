<!-- <b>Antivirus Issue:</b> If you have an antivirus on your PC with internet security, the progress bar on webpage will instantly show 100% because of request caching by your antivirus software. There is no fix for this unless you want to disable your antivirus or whitelist your local IP addresses in it. ( Same is the case with iOS, safari will cache the outgoing requests ) -->
