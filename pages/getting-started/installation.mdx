### For PlatformIO

<Callout type="info">
Required changes in platformio.ini

As ElegantOTA supports multiple architectures, PlatformIO will try to include all the dependencies automatically which will often result in compilation errors. To mitigate this issue, please follow these steps:

1. Delete `.pio/libdeps` folder (if it exists) in your project before proceeding.
2. Open `platformio.ini` file of your project.
3. Add the following line inside your `platformio.ini` file:

    ```ini
    lib_compat_mode = strict
    ```

4. Save the changes to the `platformio.ini` file.

#### Manual Installation

1. Download the [Repository](https://github.com/ayushsharma82/ElegantOTA/archive/master.zip)
