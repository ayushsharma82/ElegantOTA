# Examples

The ElegantOTA repository provides two example setups: Demo and Async Demo. These examples showcase how to integrate OTA (Over-The-Air) updates into your project using different types of web servers, allowing you to pick the best option for your specific needs.

## Demo

Demo example is for people who are using the inbuilt webserver of their platform. This is meant to run without any dependencies.

## Async Demo

Async demo example utilizes AsyncWebServer which has significant performance gains. Only use this example as reference when your project is using AsyncWebServer. Know more about this in "Async Mode" documentation.


You can find those examples in the [ElegantOTA repository](https://github.com/ayushsharma82/ElegantOTA/tree/master/examples).
