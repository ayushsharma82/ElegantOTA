# Hardware ID

The Hardware ID feature in ElegantOTA is shown on the ElegantOTA Pro portal. This ID should be a unique string that helps you easily identify the specific hardware device among others in your network.

You can set the hardware ID for your device using the `ElegantOTA.setID("xyz");` function.

## Reference

```cpp
#include <ElegantOTAPro.h>

void setup() {
  // Initialize your hardware and other configurations here

  // Set the Hardware ID
  ElegantOTA.setID("my_device_001");

  // Additional setup code
}

void loop() {
  // Your main loop code here
}
```

In the above example, the `ElegantOTA.setID("my_device_001");` function call assigns the Hardware ID "my_device_001" to the device.


## Best Practices

To make the most of the Hardware ID feature, consider the following best practices:

- Choose a Hardware ID that is unique to each device to avoid conflicts.

- Avoid using special characters or spaces in the Hardware ID, as these might cause issues when used in network communication or file naming.

- Document and keep track of the Hardware IDs for all your devices to ensure proper management.

- Ensure that the Hardware ID is set during the device's initialization phase, such as in the `setup()` function, to guarantee that it is properly configured before any network or communication activities.
