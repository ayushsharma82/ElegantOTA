Branding in this context refers to the logo that is displayed on the ElegantOTA portal during the OTA update process. You can customize the logo by defining the logo image as a byte array in the `logo.h` and `logo.cpp` files of the library's source code without even touching HTML or CSS.

## Procedure

To add your custom logo on the ElegantOTA Pro portal, follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Prepare logo

First, you need to create or obtain the logo image you want to display on the ElegantOTA portal during OTA updates. Ensure that the logo image is in a suitable format, such as a SVG (recommended) / PNG or JPG file and make sure your image is optimized & small in file size.

### Convert logo to a byte array

To include the logo in your library, you'll need to convert the image into a byte array.

1. Go to [File2Raw utility](https://file2raw.labrat.one/) ( I created this utility a few years back for the purpose of converting files into byte array for C++ applications ).
2. Select your logo.
3. Select "Gzip Compress" & "Use PROGMEM (Arduino)".
4. Click "Convert".

### Modify `logo.h`

1. Open the `logo.h` file in your ElegantOTA library source code.

2. Locate the `ELEGANTOTA_LOGO` byte array declaration, which should look like this:

   ```cpp
   extern const uint8_t ELEGANTOTA_LOGO[];
   ```

3. Replace the length of the `ELEGANTOTA_LOGO` array with your custom logo's byte array length.

4. Locate the `ELEGANTOTA_LOGO_MIME` variable, which defines the MIME type of your logo image. By default, it is set to `image/png`. If your logo is in a different format (e.g., JPEG), update the `ELEGANTOTA_LOGO_MIME` variable to the appropriate MIME type.

5. Set `ELEGANTOTA_LOGO_WIDTH` & `ELEGANTOTA_LOGO_HEIGHT` according to your desired size which will be displayed on the webpage.

### Modify `logo.cpp`

1. Open the `logo.cpp` file in your ElegantOTA library source code.

2. Replace the contents of the `ELEGANTOTA_LOGO` array with your custom logo's byte array generated in File2Raw utility.


### Upload firmware

After making these changes, compile and upload the firmware with modified ElegantOTA library to your device.

</Steps>

## Final Words

Once you have uploaded the modified ElegantOTA library to your device, the custom logo will be displayed on the ElegantOTA Portal webpage during OTA updates.

That's it! You have successfully added custom branding to the ElegantOTA portal by defining the logo as a byte array in the `logo.h` and `logo.cpp` files. Your logo will now be displayed on the ElegantOTA portal.
