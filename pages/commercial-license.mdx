# Commercial License

ElegantOTA Lite (open-source version) and ElegantOTA Pro are two different versions of the same OTA (Over-The-Air) update library, each with its own set of features and licensing terms. Here's a comparison between ElegantOTA Lite, which is open-source and AGPL-3.0 based, and ElegantOTA Pro:

1. Licensing:
   - ElegantOTA Lite: This version is open-source and released under the AGPL-3.0 license. It means that it's freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. However, if you use ElegantOTA Lite in a commercial product, the AGPL-3.0 license requires you to make the source code of your product, including any modifications to ElegantOTA Lite, available to the public.

   - ElegantOTA Pro: This version is offered under a one-time charge for a commercial license. It allows you to use ElegantOTA Pro in a commercial product without the requirement to open-source your proprietary code. The commercial license provides more flexibility and protection for businesses.

2. Support:
   - ElegantOTA Lite: Support for ElegantOTA Lite is typically community-driven. You may find help through online forums, documentation, or user-contributed resources. However, professional support may be limited.

   - ElegantOTA Pro: ElegantOTA Pro includes dedicated support and assistance. This can be essential for businesses that require timely and reliable support to ensure their OTA update process runs smoothly.

In summary, the choice between ElegantOTA Lite and ElegantOTA Pro depends on your specific needs and the nature of your project:

- If you are working on an open-source project or have no concerns about the AGPL-3.0 license's requirements and need basic OTA update functionality, ElegantOTA Lite is a viable choice.

- If you are developing a commercial product, ElegantOTA Pro provides a more comprehensive and professionally supported solution while allowing you to maintain the proprietary nature of your code. However, it comes with a one-time commercial licensing fee.
